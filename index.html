        <p>It is said that after the Mahabharata war ended, the Pandavas were full of remorse at having lost thousands to the violence.  They handed over the kingdom's reins to grandson Parikshit and started for Varanasi to seek Lord Shiva's pardon.</p>
<p>
            Not interested in meeting them, Shivji leaves Varanasi/Benaras/Kashi and heads for the Himalayas in the form of a Bull (Nandi, the Bull). He reappears in Guptakashi as the bull and the Pandavas reach there. 
        </p>
        <p>         
            Shiva escapes again and this time reappears as the bull in five different parts of India as 5 different parts of the bull's body: the face at Rudranath, arms at Tungnath, navel and stomach at Madhyamaheshwar, the locks at Kalpeshwar and the hump at Kedarnath. The powerful Pandava - Bhima - is said to have grabbed the bull's tail, forcing him to appear before them and forgive them. The Pandava brothers then built the first temple at Kedarnath. 
        </p>
         <p>
            These 5 places where the bull had appeared in parts after diving underground are known as the Panch (5) Kedar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Situated in a region of Glacial activity, the temple is said to have been under snow for 400 years. The signs of glacial assault are still there on the walls, say geologists. The temple was miraculously saved by a BhimShila (massive boulder) that rolled down the mountains during the horrific cloudburst and natural calamity in June 2013. It is said Baba Bhairo Nath saves the temple.</p>

       <p> Kedarnath Dham, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, is one of the most paramount locations for worshipers of Shiva.
